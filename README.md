# NeuralRedactedTextDetection

This repository contains the code and experiments associated with the paper "XXXX", currently under submission at IJDAR.

## Installation

The repository includes both a requirements.txt and a environment.yml file for installing the required dependencies. This reposotiry uses the Mask2Former and Detectron2 libraries from Meta for the experiments. Although the requirements file contains versions of these packages, if you want to run the Mask2Former model on your own GPU, you will have to compile the 'XX' CUDA operation yourself for your own system. You can do this by following the installation instructions HERE.
